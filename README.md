    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The software project is called Draw It Or Lose It, which is an image based web game for the client The Gaming Room. As a web app, this game would need to perform well on multiple operating platforms and browsers.

    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I tried to be thourough when thinking of pros and cons of operating systems, et cetera. 

    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Knowing the big picture helps me understand why the changes I'm making are necessary, which makes me more eager to work on them.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I actually made some edits before my final submission- I got this client and a client from a prior client in a different assignment confused, which resulted in some confusing things in the table. I deleted all of that before the final submission.

    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
If the user's needs aren't accounted for, no user will actually enjoy using the application. In this project, that's especially important- this is a program that the user would be interacting with for fun. If it's too frustrating, there's nothing stopping the user from dropping Draw It or Lose It altogether.
    
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
This software was easier to imagine because I have worked on a web app professionally before, and I interact with web apps as a user on a daily basis. Without that, I would still want to imagine myself as the user and as the programmer, because without that, it's easy to miss the crucial needs of either.
